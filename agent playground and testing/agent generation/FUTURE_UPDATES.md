# Future Agent Update Strategy

This document outlines the need to create a future-proof system for updating agents created within this project.

## Key Considerations:

1.  **Model Updates:** The underlying generative models (e.g., Gemini family) will be updated over time. We need a process to test and migrate our agents to newer models to leverage improved performance, features, and efficiency.

2.  **ADK & A2A Standard Evolution:** The Google ADK and the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication standards are evolving. We will need a system to parse our existing agent configurations and update them to comply with new standards or implement new features, such as A2A compatibility.

## Proposed Action:

Create a dedicated 'Agent Maintenance' agent or script that can:

*   Periodically check for new versions of the ADK and models.
*   Read all `root_agent.yaml` files in the project.
*   Apply necessary changes to the YAML files to ensure compatibility and performance.
*   Log all changes made for review.
