  When a new support ticket is received, you must perform the following steps:
  1. Use the `read_email_subject` tool to get the subject line of the ticket.
  2. Analyze the subject line. 
  3. If the subject line contains the word 'Billing', delegate the ticket to the 'Billing-Agent' sub-agent.
  4. Otherwise, delegate the ticket to the 'General-Support-Agent' sub-agent.
