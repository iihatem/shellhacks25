# Agent Testing & Validation Strategy

This document outlines a multi-layered strategy for testing and validating the `AgentConfig` YAML files generated by the pipeline. The goal is to ensure that the configured agents are effective, accurate, and behave as expected.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

Testing in our "no-code" pipeline focuses on the integrity and logic of the configuration, rather than testing code. We will employ a series of automated and semi-automated checks to validate the generated `AgentConfig` files.

## 2. Testing Layers

We will use a four-layer testing approach:

### Layer 1: Schema Validation (Automated)

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the generated YAML is syntactically correct and adheres to our defined `AgentConfig` schema.
*   **Process:** This is the most basic test. After "Agent Smith" generates a YAML file, a validator tool will automatically check it against the schema definition.
*   **Outcome:** A simple pass/fail result. If it fails, the configuration is rejected, and an error is logged, indicating a bug in the "Agent Smith" generator.

### Layer 2: Logical Coherence Test (Automated, LLM-based)

*   **Purpose:** To check for logical consistency within the `AgentConfig` file.
*   **Process:** A specialized "Tester Agent" will be used for this layer. It will analyze the `AgentConfig` and answer the following questions:
    1.  Does the `instruction` field only reference tools and sub-agents that are listed in the `tools` and `sub_agents` sections of the same file?
    2.  Is there a clear path of execution in the `instruction`? Are there any obvious dead ends or infinite loops?
    3.  Does the `expected_behavior` for sub-agents align with the actions described in the `instruction`?
*   **Outcome:** The Tester Agent will provide a report with a pass/fail status and a list of any logical inconsistencies it found.

### Layer 3: Simulation / Dry Run (Automated)

*   **Purpose:** To simulate the execution of the agent's logic without performing any real-world actions.
*   **Process:** A "Simulation Engine" will read the `AgentConfig` file. It will receive a sample input (e.g., a fake support ticket). The engine will then walk through the `instruction` steps:
    *   When the logic dictates calling a tool, the simulator will not execute the real tool. Instead, it will check if the tool exists in the `tool_library.yaml` and return a pre-defined mock response.
    *   When the logic dictates calling a sub-agent, the simulator will simply log the call and the input that would have been passed to it.
*   **Outcome:** The simulation will produce a trace log of the agent's execution path. This allows us to see if the agent behaves as expected under a given scenario.

### Layer 4: Golden-Path Testing (Semi-Automated)

*   **Purpose:** To compare the output of "Agent Smith" against a manually created, "perfect" `AgentConfig`.
*   **Process:**
    1.  For a set of benchmark user requests, a human expert will manually create the ideal `AgentConfig` YAML file. This is the "golden path" configuration.
    2.  We then feed the same user request to "Agent Smith".
    3.  A diffing tool will compare the YAML file generated by "Agent Smith" with the golden path configuration.
*   **Outcome:** A report showing the differences between the two files. This test is crucial for evaluating and improving the performance of the "Agent Smith" generator itself.

## 3. Continuous Improvement

By using this layered testing strategy, we can not only validate each individual agent configuration but also gather data to continuously improve the "Agent Smith" generator. If we find common errors or logical flaws, we can refine Agent Smith's meta-prompt and internal logic to produce better configurations over time.
