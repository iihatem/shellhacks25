We will need to make a no code approach for the future few conversations, I want you to create a standardized pipeline that is going to be able to take in a small request, and can take that data and turn it into a customized ai agent that is compatible googles adk, and the a2a system. I would like to be able to use generative ai to help generate the structures and basics for this. Are you familiar with the google adk Agent Structure, the a2a AgentCard, and the RemoreA2aAgent models? I would be planning to have the location be stored via detail___agent.py in files. Help me design the process, pipeline and some examples for testing to ensure that the agents are well done. Sub_agents are encouraged, as that making very specific and clear agents are important. If tools are needed, I would not mind setting up extra systems and pipelines to create a list of desired tools that can help with agents work. If an tool is requestd, we should add that to a known current tool collection, that would be accessible to all other agents. Start by putting this prompt into a text document labeled "starting_prompt.txt"
