🧪 Testing Platform Agents via A2A Protocol...

📋 Testing Secretary Agent...
Secretary Response: Okay, I can certainly help you with that! To best assist you, let's break this down a bit.

For **Data Analysis**, do you have any specific goals in mind? For example:

*   **What kind of data are you working with?** (e.g., sales figures, website traffic, customer demographics)
*   **What questions are you hoping to answer with the data?** (e.g., identify trends, understand customer behavior, improve marketing ROI)
*   **What specific analysis do you need?** (e.g., descriptive statistics, regression analysis, data visualization)

For **Content Creation**, could you tell me more about what you need? For example:

*   **What type of content are you looking to create?** (e.g., blog posts, social media updates, website copy, marketing materials)
*   **What is the topic or subject matter of the content?**

*   **What is the purpose of the content?** (e.g., inform, entertain, persuade, drive sales)

Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can connect you with the appropriate specialists on our platform who can provide the best assistance for data analysis and content creation.


🏢 Testing Hiring Manager Agent...
Hiring Manager Response: Okay, I can help with that. It seems like the existing agents do not have the specific expertise in financial analysis and budgeting that you require. Therefore, I will create a new agent to fulfill this need.

I will create a `data_analyst` agent with specialized instructions for financial analysis and budgeting. This agent will be equipped to handle tasks such as financial modeling, budget forecasting, variance analysis, and investment analysis.

Agent Details:
- Agent Type: `data_analyst`
- Specialization: Financial Analysis and Budgeting
- Capabilities: Financial modeling, budget forecasting, variance analysis, investment analysis

I have created the `data_analyst` agent with the specified specialization. This agent should now be able to assist you with your financial analysis and budgeting tasks.


📊 Testing Data Analyst Agent...
Data Analyst Response: Okay, I can analyze the performance trends of e-commerce companies in Q4 2024. To provide a focused and relevant analysis, could you clarify the following:

*   **Which e-commerce companies or types of e-commerce companies are you interested in?** (e.g., Amazon, Shopify stores, luxury e-commerce, a specific region, etc.)
*   **What specific performance metrics are most important?** (e.g., revenue growth, website traffic, conversion rates, customer acquisition cost, average order value, net profit margin, etc.)
*   **Do you have a specific region or market in mind?** (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific)
*   **Are there any specific events or market conditions that should be considered?** (e.g., major sales events like Black Friday/Cyber Monday, economic downturns, changes in regulations)
*   **What data sources are available?** (e.g., company financial reports, industry reports, web analytics data. Do I need to find these myself?)

In the meantime, I will perform some general searches to gather preliminary information about e-commerce performance in Q4 2024.



🔍 Testing Researcher Agent...
Researcher Response: Okay, I will research the latest developments in sustainable energy technologies. To make sure I cover the most important aspects, I will focus on:

*   What are the newest advancements in solar energy?
*   What are the newest advancements in wind energy?
*   What are the newest advancements in battery storage?
*   What are the newest advancements in geothermal energy?
*   What are the newest advancements in hydroelectric energy?



✍️ Testing Content Creator Agent...
